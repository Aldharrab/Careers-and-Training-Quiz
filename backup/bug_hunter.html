            A bug bounty hunter is a cybersecurity professional who searches for vulnerabilities in systems,
             networks, or web applications and reports them to the organization in exchange for rewards or bounties.
              Unlike penetration testers who are often employed directly by companies, bug bounty hunters participate in public or private
               bounty programs, working independently or as part of a community. They use various tools, techniques, and methodologies to
                discover security flaws, such as injection vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, or authentication issues. Once a vulnerability is found, 
                they responsibly disclose it, allowing the organization to fix the issue before malicious hackers can exploit it. Bug bounty hunters play a
                 crucial role in improving overall security and helping organizations
             safeguard their digital assets while complying with security standards.
