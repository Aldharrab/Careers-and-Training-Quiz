            Operational security (OPSEC) is a critical process used by organizations and individuals to protect sensitive information from falling into the 
            wrong hands. It involves identifying critical data, analyzing potential threats, and implementing measures to safeguard that information. In 
            cybersecurity, OPSEC helps prevent attackers from gaining insight into an organization’s operations, 
            security measures, or vulnerabilities. This can include protecting communication channels, securing access to physical locations, and
             minimizing the exposure of sensitive data online.

            OPSEC professionals focus on developing strategies that reduce risks, such as limiting the sharing of sensitive information, monitoring for data leaks, and applying encryption and access controls. They often work closely with other security teams to ensure that both digital and physical assets are well-protected, keeping adversaries from gathering intelligence that could lead to attacks or security breaches.
